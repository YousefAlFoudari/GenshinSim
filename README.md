Ongoing Genshin Impact wish simulator.

Genshin Impact is a free-to-play gacha game developed by miHoYo. From Wikipedia: "Gacha games are video games that implement the gacha mechanic. This is somewhat similar to loot boxes, inducing players to spend in-game currency to receive a random virtual item. Most of these games are free-to-play mobile games, where the gacha serves as an incentive to spend real-world money."

In Genshin Impact, this gacha system is known as "wishing". My simulator aims to accurately replicate that system and to provide the user comprehensive statistical feedback. This project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook.
